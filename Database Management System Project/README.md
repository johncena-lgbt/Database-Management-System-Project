# DBS Practical

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

2. Create a .env file with the following content

    ```
    DB_USER=
    DB_PASSWORD=
    DB_HOST=
    DB_DATABASE=
    DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT=1
    PORT=3000
    ```

3. Update the .env content with your database credentials accordingly.

4. Install dependencies by running `npm install`

5. Start the app by running `npm start`. Alternatively to use hot reload, start the app by running `npm run dev`.

6. You should see `App listening on port 3000`

8. (Optional) install the plugins recommended in `.vscode/extensions.json`

## Instructions

Open the page, `http://localhost:3000`, replace the port number accordingly if you app is not listening to port 3000

## Prerequisites

Before starting the sever, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- BCRYPT
- jsonwebtoken
- pg-camelcase
- pg
- nodemon
- express
- dotenv

## Setting Up Environment Variables

This repository provides instructions for setting up environment variables using a `.env` file in an Express.js application. The environment variables will be used in the `database.js` file.

### Setup

To set up environment variables for your Express.js application, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `.env` file and add the following lines:

   ```
   DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
   DB_USER=<your_database_user>
   DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
   DB_DATABASE=<your_database_name>
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=<duration>
   JWT_ALGORITHM=<selected_algorithm>
   ```

   Replace `<your_database_host>`, `<your_database_user>`, `<your_database_password>`, and `<your_database_name>` with the appropriate values for your database connection.

   Replace `<your_secret_key>`, `<duration>`, and `<selected_algorithm>` with the appropriate values for your JSON web token usage.

   For example:

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=1234
   DB_DATABASE=pokemon
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
   JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
   ```

   Note: Make sure there are no spaces around the equal sign (=) in each line.

3. Save the `.env` file.

### Usage

The `database.js` file in the directory uses the `dotenv` package to read the `.env` file and set the environment variables. Here's an example of how the `database.js` file should look:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config(); // Read .env file and set environment variables

const mysql = require('mysql2');

const setting = {
    connectionLimit: 10, // Set limit to 10 connections
    host: process.env.DB_HOST, // Get host from environment variable
    user: process.env.DB_USER, // Get user from environment variable
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD, // Get password from environment variable
    database: process.env.DB_DATABASE, // Get database from environment variable
    multipleStatements: true, // Allow multiple SQL statements
    dateStrings: true // Return date as string instead of Date object
}

const pool = mysql.createPool(setting);

module.exports = pool;
```

The `dotenv` package is used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file, and `process.env` is used to access these variables in your code.

Make sure to include the `require('dotenv').config();` line at the beginning of your file to load the environment variables from the `.env` file.

## Install Dependencies

1. Open the terminal in VSCode by going to `View` > `Terminal` or using the shortcut `Ctrl + ``.

2. Navigate to the project root directory.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Error Handling
The application implements robust error handling to ensure stability and provide clear feedback. This includes handling common scenarios like invalid user input, failed database operations, and server errors. Each API endpoint is designed to return meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes, enhancing the debugging process and user experience.

## Testing
API endpoints were thoroughly tested using Postman, ensuring correct responses and error handling. Additionally, MySQL was used to verify database operations and schema integrity.
